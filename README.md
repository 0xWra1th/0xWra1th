## Welcome
I am currently working on cyber security certifications(Sec+, eWAPT) while studying CS at university but in my spare time I want to work on a custom pentesting tool set. Bruteforcers, enumerations, scanners, backdoors and my own implementation of exploits.

### Stack:
I use Ubuntu as my main OS and VSCode as my main IDE. My favorite Web Frameworks are Django and NestJS with Angular.

### Interests:
I focus on Cyber Security but I also enjoy creating things, web and software development.
   
### Languages:
Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, English, HTML, CSS, PHP
